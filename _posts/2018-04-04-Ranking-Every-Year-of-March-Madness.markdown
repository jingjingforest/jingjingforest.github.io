Listening to sports talk radio or talking to your coworker on Slack, it might seem as if this yearâ€™s tournament was the craziest ever. There was the first ever #16 seed to upset a #1 seed. Loyola-Chicago became the fourth #11 seed to make it to the Final Four, and Kansas State and Florida State both made it to Elite Eight as #9 seeds.  With all of that madness on one side of the bracket, the other side has been much tamer with two #1 seeds making it to the Final Four.
So how much Madness was there this March? How does it compare to 2011 when 8th-seeded Butler made it to the championship game and VCU made it to the Final Four as a #11 seed? Was it crazier than 1985 when Villanova won the championship as a #8 seed? 

The short answer is I have 2018 ranked third behind, behind 2014 and 2013.
